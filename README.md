# ECM-C

## About
This is my implementation of ECM (Elliptic Curve Method) for factoring integers in C.  
It is a hobby I enjoy during my free time (Christmas or summer vacation) and  
_cannot_ compete with other highly-otimized software such as [GMP-ECM](https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/records/ecm/devel.html).
